## Features

- Integration of GraphQL with Spring Boot
- Demonstrates how to define GraphQL schema, queries, mutations, and subscriptions
- Provides examples of GraphQL queries and mutations
- Includes configurations for running the Spring Boot application
- Utilizes dependencies such as Spring Data MongoDB for data storage
